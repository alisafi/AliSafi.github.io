      <br/>

SKILLS
======
* Robust fundamental knowledgebase in photonics and optics, optoelectronics, electromagnetics, solid-state physics, electronics, mathematics, and data analytics.
* Strong simulation and coding skills in Lumerical FDTD, MATLAB, C, and Python.
* Strong hands-on skills in optics, fabrication and characterization of micro/nanostructures, and electronic circuit implementation.
  
WORK EXPERIENCE
======
* **ECE Department at Virginia Tech**, Research Assistant in Nanophotonics (Aug 2016-present)
  *	Designed, fabricated, and analyzed hybrid plasmonic-photonic metamaterials to induce directional and enhanced non-linear emission from metals for ultrafast sensing applications (Oct 2020). 
  * Designed, fabricated, and analyzed metal-insulator-metal (MIM) multiresonant plasmonic metamaterials for broadband field enhancement and perfect light absorption in a theoretical-experimental work (Jul 2020). 
  * Developed the Black-Box Coupled-Mode Theory, a novel analysis framework to design and understand the dynamics in electromagnetic resonator systems (May 2020).
  * Developed the Ultrafast Optics lab; Determined, negotiated, ordered and setup the required equipment such as Ti:Sapphire laser, Optical Parametric Oscillator, etc. in a team of two graduate students (Feb 2020).
  *	Classified and analyzed the different possible strategies to create multiresonant plasmonic systems with spatial mode overlap for the first time (Jun 2019).
  *	Developed the Optoelectronics lab course by designing and writing the syllabus, lab manuals, and lab lectures. Determined, ordered and setup the required lab equipment (Mar 2019). 
  *	Designed, fabricated, and analyzed MIM nanoantennas with different geometries in team projects for photothermal, nonlinear optics and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy applications (2018-2020).
  *	Developed several computer programs for processing and clustering of the measurement data (2016-2020).
  *	Designed and held photonics outreach sessions for middle school students (Jul 2017).

* **Thin Film Lab at the University of Tehran**, Research Assistant in Nanoelectronics (Aug 2013-Aug 2016)
  *	Developed novel core-shell carbon-silicon nanostructures as high-rate supercapacitor electrodes. The key novelty was conformal coating of high-quality amorphous carbon thin films (Jul 2016).
  *	Worked as transmission electron and scanning electron Microscopes operator (Aug 2015-Jan 2016).
  *	Developed computer programs to analyze: (1) electron diffraction patterns, (2) lens systems (Dec 2015).
  *	Developed computer programs for advanced processing of electrochemical measurements (Aug 2014).
  *	Designed and built a glove box and a test cell for Li-ion battery tests in a teamwork (May 2014).
